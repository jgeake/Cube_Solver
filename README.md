# Cube_Solver
Code to automatically solve a rubik's cube, step by step

This program is made to create an algorithm to solve a 2x2 rubik's cube. It is the beginning of a larger project to create a self-solving cube. The current version does not have instructions - those will be added in the future - and is not the finished copy. It is to be integrated into a later, larger project.

Future updates will include instructions while solving, a website, and an app, to go along with the self-solving cube. This are currently in progress and will hopefully be completed in a couple weeks to a couple months. Files will be launched at that point.
